The main idea is a factory of mobiles (fuck bottles in the map...), so maybe have the design focused on this?

Dashboard
    General Information
    - MTBF general (2)
    - MTTR general (2)
    - Cycles 
    - Cycle Time (1)
    - Units lost (5/6)
        - Reason Lost units (5/6)
    - Production Rate per machine (5/6)
    - Timeline (2)
    - Utilization (1)
    - Performance per area

Workers
    - List of workers (with link to worker page)
    - Status of workers, Performance?
    - Collaboration with robots
    - Work time

    Per worker page?
        - Profile
        - Graphs of historical performance
        - Graphs of work time
        - Knowledge or rank
        - Area working
        - etc
    
Collaboration - Ni puta idea
    - Stats about robot and human Collaboration, such as amount of cycles or products being assembled
    by the human and robot?
    
Area information
    - Production
    - Issues
    - Workers (with link to worker page)
    - Robots as a table? or similar (links to robots, as in the map)

Robots
    - List of robots (with link to personalized robot page)
    - Stats of robots such as ranking of most productive one, most issues, etc
    - MTBF and MTTR ranking of all robots
    - Issues?
    - Most uptime robot etc

    Per Robot
        - MTBF - Mean time before failure
        - MTTR - Mean time to repair
        - Uptime
        - Downtime
        - Temperature
        - Humidity
        - Collaboration with humans? (As it is the main objective of the project) Some chart
